## g33gle:
1. Info
    - Small-scale search-engine
    - Using a mock google homepage, establish connections via server, parse user requests, crawl index files and return responses.
    - important files: HttpServer.cc, ServerSocket.cc, http333d.cc
    - sample is ~1/4 of the project's total code.
2. Role
    - Developed data structures and logic to support the construction, storage, and iteration of index files.
    - Extended Socket class for use in a client-server relationship.
    - Integrated code into existing framework.

## Naive Bayes:
1. Info
    - small file containing a bayes classifier implementation
    - more than happy to submit something else, figured a single file might be welcomed after g33gle.
